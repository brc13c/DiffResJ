<body>These tools utilize a custom binary format for trajectories, the
mdp.sdb format. In order to use these programs, your own trajectories
must be converted to this format. To this end, three conversion programs
are provided, one to convert from a LAMMPS text dump file, one for XYZ files, and one to
convert from a custom XML format (described in <a href="FileFormat.html">Produce trajectory data</a>).<br><br>To
convert from the XML format, the program ConvertSDXtoSDB from the
converters package can be run. This program only needs the name of the
source XML file and the name of the file to generate. As an example,
the following command converts an XML trajectory file named
ParticleData.xml to an mdp.sdb file named ParticleData.mdp.sdb.<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ converters.ConvertSDXtoSDB -src=ParticleData.xml -dst=ParticleData.mdp.sdb<br><br>In
order to convert LAMMPS dump files, they must contain atom information
in the following order: id, type, unwrapped x coordinate [, unwrapped y
coordinate, unwrapped z coordinate], x velocity [, y velocity, z
velocity]. Given a dump in this format, the program LAMMPSDumpToSDX can
convert it to the previously mentioned XML format. This program
requires the source dump file, the name of the file to generate, the
dimensionality of the simulation (1d, 2d, 3d) and the timestep of the
simulation. As an example, the following command converts a LAMMPS dump
named melt.dump (containing two dimensional data with a timestep of
0.001) to an XML file named ParticleData.xml.<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ converters.LAMMPSDumpToSDX -src=melt.dump -dst=ParticleData.xml -dim=2 -tim=0.001<br><br>XYZ
files can be converted using the XYZToSDX program. This program
requires the name of the xyz file, the name of the file to generate,
the dimensionality of the simulation, and the time between timesteps in
the simulation. As an example, the following command converts an XYZ
file named melt.xyz (that contains 3D data every 0.001 time units) to
an XML file named ParticleData.xml<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ converters.XYZToSDX -src=melt.xyz -dst=ParticleData.xml -dim=3 -tim=0.001<br><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a href="README.html">Back to Index</a>
