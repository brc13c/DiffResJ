<body>Both the GUI and the CLI program load a full time-step of data into memory at a given time.
If the number of particles you are dealing with is less than one million,
that should fit in the main memory of a modern PC. However, you may have a large number of particles,
or you may want to speed up the computation. In both cases, you'll have to manually run each stage
of the program.<br><br>

GENERATING RESAMPLE FILES<br><br>

The first step is to generate resample files for your trajectory data. 
These files are used to estimate the error in the diffusion coefficient (by resampling from the trajectory data).
The first phase is to generate raw lists of particle numbers.
The program for this is located in the resample package (GenerateResamples), and expects as arguments the
trajectory file, a prefix for generated files, and the number of files to generate.<br><br>

As an example, if you wanted to generate 42 resamples for Trajectory.mdp.sdb, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ resample.GenerateResamples -for=Trajectory.mdp.sdb -nam=Resamp -num=42<br><br>

would generate 42 files named Resamp##.rsm.sdb containing lists of particle indices.<br><br>

The previous program generates resample files in random order;
however, the actual resampling programs expect these files to be sorted in ascending order.
So, the next phase is to sort the resample files.
For this, you'll use another program in the resample package: SortResamples.
SortResamples expects six arguments: the resample file prefix, the file index to sort from,
the file index to sort to, the sorted resample file prefix, and two working files.
The file indices need to have leading zeroes if the resample files have more significant digits in their names
(for example, if you made 1000 files, index 1 should be written as 00001).
The working files need to be two file names you aren't using.<br><br>

As an example, if you wanted to sort the 42 resample files generated above, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ resample.SortResamples -spr=Resamp -low=00 -hig=41 -dpr=SortedResample -wk1=working1 -wk2=working2<br><br>

would generate 42 files named SortedResample##.srs.sdb containing the sorted contents of Resamp##.rsm.sdb
(it would also clobber and delete anything you may have had in working1 and working2).<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="SPLITDATA"></a>
SPLITTING DATA<br><br>

The next step is to split the trajectory data into multiple files.
This is accomplished by using splits.SplitData, which takes the name of the trajectory file, the number
of files to split it into, and the prefix for each generated file, and will parcel the trajectory data into
smaller files.<br><br>

As an example, if you have a file Trajectory.mdp.sdb, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ splits.SplitData -src=Trajectory.mdp.sdb -num=10 -dpr=Trajectory<br><br>

will split the data in Trajectory.mdp.sdb into 10 files named Trajectory##.mdp.sdb,
with each number representing a different set of particles.<br><br>

It's worth noting that, at this point, each split file can be processed independently.<br><br>

<hr>
<br>
Up to this point, all the steps have been the same regardless of whether you wanted to calculate the 
diffusion coefficient by examining mean square displacement or velocity autocorrelation. At this point,
the two differ. The procedure for finding diffusion coefficients from velocity autocorrelation will come
first, followed by mean square displacement.<br><br>

<hr>
<hr>
<a name="VELAUTO"></a>
VELOCITY AUTOCORRELATION
<hr>
<hr>
<a name="CALCVELAUTO"></a>
CALCULATING AUTOCORRELATION<br><br>

Before you can do anything with autocorrelation, you'll need to calculate it. This can be done with
the CalculateAutocorrelation program in the vac package. It takes three arguments: the trajectory file
to calculate the autocorrelations for, the file to write autocorrelations to, and a working file.<br><br>

As an example, if you have a file Trajectory07.mdp.sdb, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.CalculateAutocorrelation -src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb -wrk=working07<br><br>

will calculate the velocity autocorrelations for the velocities of each particle at different lags,
and write the results to Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb.<br><br>There
are several other versions of this program that run in less time, but
are less thorough in calculating the autocorrelation. The first option
is CalculateAutocorrelationOnePass, which calculates the
autocorrelation at each lag as the result of one dot product (current
time versus time zero). It only takes two options, the source
trajectory and the output file. The following is an example invocation.<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.CalculateAutocorrelationOnePass -src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb<br><br>The
next option is CalculateAutocorrelationClipRepeat, which behaves like
CalculateAutocorrelationOnePass but, after some number of timesteps,
stops looking at the initial time and designates a new time zero (with
the autocorrelation averaged across the clipping windows). It takes the
same arguments as CalculateAutocorrelation, plus one more argument to
specify the clipping period. The following is an example that clips
after 500 timesteps.<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.CalculateAutocorrelationClipRepeat
-src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb -wrk=working07
-clp=500<br><br>The
last option is CalculateAutocorrelationMultiTau, which performs a
variant of the multi-tau method (link) that only uses the first
velocity in each block, rather than averaging everything in the block.
This takes three arguments, the source trajectory, the output file, and
the number of lower level blocks to include in a higher level block.
The following is an example that aggregates 16 blocks for each level of
course graining.<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.CalculateAutocorrelationMultiTau -src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb -agg=16<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="INTVELAUTO"></a>
INTEGRATING AUTOCORRELATION<br><br>

The next task is to integrate the velocity autocorrelation of each particle individually (these integrals
will be averaged after resampling). This can be done with IntegrateAutocorrelation (in vac). This program
takes three arguments: the name of the individual autocorrelations to read in, the name of the
integrated autocorrelations to write out, and the dimensionality of the source simulation.<br><br>

As an example, if you have a file named Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.IntegrateAutocorrelation -src=Autocorrelation07.vac.sdb -dst=SingleDiff07.ivc.sdb -dim=1 -vcr=0.05<br><br>
will calculate a diffusion coefficient for each particle from each
particle's velocity autocorrelation
(assuming the particles are free to move in one dimension). This
particular command will cease integrating once the mean square
autocorrelation drops below 0.05 times the square of the initial
autocorrelation (set to 0 to integrate all data; this will likely
increase uncertainty).<br>

<hr>
<a name="COLVELAUTO"></a>
COLLECTING DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

So at this point, you should have files containing the diffusion coefficients based off of each particle.
However, the data are probably scattered across different files (see SPLITTING DATA), so the next task is
to collect all the data back into one file using vac.CollectAutocorrelations. This takes one argument
specifying the name of the output file, and then a list of arguments specifying the files to collect.<br><br>

As an example, if you have ten files named SingleDiff00.ivc.sdb through SingleDiff09.ivc.sdb, the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.CollectAutocorrelations -dst=SingleDiff.ivc.sdb
-src=SingleDiff00.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff01.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff02.ivc.sdb
-src=SingleDiff03.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff04.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff05.ivc.sdb
-src=SingleDiff06.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff07.ivc.sdb -src=SingleDiff08.ivc.sdb
-src=SingleDiff09.ivc.sdb<br><br>

will collect the particle diffusion coefficients into a single file. Also, it's worth mentioning that,
if the order of the input files for CollectAutocorrelations is the same as the order from SplitData,
the coefficients in the final file will be in the same order as the particles in the trajectory data (while
these programs are unconcerned with particle order, other programs might not be).<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="RESVELAUTO"></a>
RESAMPLING DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

The next step is to actually perform the resampling. This can be done using the program
vac.ResampleParticleDiffusion, which takes the original particle diffusion file, and pairs
of resample file names and output file names.<br><br>

As an example, if you have three resample files (SortedResamp0.srs.sdb through SortedResamp2.srs.sdb)
and a collection of per-particle diffusion coefficients (SingleDiff.ivc.sdb), the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.ResampleParticleDiffusion
-src=SingleDiff.ivc.sdb -rsi=SortedResamp0.srs.sdb -rso=ResampDiff0.ivc.sdb
-rsi=SortedResamp1.srs.sdb -rso=ResampDiff1.ivc.sdb -rsi=SortedResamp2.srs.sdb
-rso=ResampDiff2.ivc.sdb<br><br>

will create three files (ResampDiff 0 through 2) containing the resampled data from SingleDiff.<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="DIFFVELAUTO"></a>
CALCULATING DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

The next step is to find the average diffusion coefficient for each resample. This can be done using
the program vac.AverageParticleCoefficients. This takes the name of the file to write global diffusion
coefficients to, then one or more resampled particle diffusion coefficient files.<br><br>

As an example, if you have three files containing resampled data (ResampDiff0.ivc.sdb through ResampDiff2.ivc.sdb),
the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ vac.AverageParticleCoefficients
-dst=AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb -src=ResampDiff0.ivc.sdb -src=ResampDiff1.ivc.sdb
-src=ResampDiff2.ivc.sdb<br><br>

will create a file named AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb which contains the particle averaged diffusion coefficients
for each of the three input files.<br><br>

It's worth noting that you don't have to run all the resample files through this program at
the same time (this can be done in groups of resample files, with the pieces put together later
using <a href="#COLDIFFCOEFFS">another program</a>).

<hr>
<hr>
<a name="MSDISP"></a>
MEAN SQUARE DISPLACEMENT
<hr>
<hr>
<a name="MSDISPCALCSQDISP"></a>
CALCULATING SQUARE DISPLACEMENT<br><br>

The first step in getting diffusion coefficients from mean square displacement is to
find the square displacement of all the particles (averaged across all possible lags).
This can be done with the CalculateSquareDisplacement program in the msd package. It takes
three arguments: the trajectory file, the file to write square displacements to, and a working file.<br><br>

As an example, if you have a file Trajectory07.mdp.sdb, the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.CalculateSquareDisplacement
-src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=SquareDisplacement07.sd.sdb
-wrk=working07<br><br>

will calculate the square displacement for the positions of each particle at different lags,
and write the results to SquareDisplacement07.sd.sdb.<br><br>There are several other versions of this program that run in
less time, but are less thorough in calculating the displacement.
The first option is CalculateSquareDisplacementOnePass, which calculates
the displacement at each lag as the result of one difference
(current time versus time zero). It only takes two options, the source
trajectory and the output file. The following is an example invocation.<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.CalculateSquareDisplacementOnePass -src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=SquareDisplacement07.sd.sdb<br><br>The
next option is CalculateSquareDisplacementClipRepeat, which behaves
like&nbsp;CalculateSquareDisplacementOnePass but, after some number of
timesteps,
stops looking at the initial time and designates a new time zero (with
the displacement averaged across the clipping windows). It takes the
same arguments as&nbsp;CalculateSquareDisplacement, plus one more
argument to
specify the clipping period. The following is an example that clips
after 500 timesteps.<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.CalculateSquareDisplacementClipRepeat
-src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=SquareDisplacement07.sd.sdb
-wrk=working07 -clp=500<br><br>The
last option is CalculateSquareDisplacementMultiTau, which performs a
variant of the multi-tau method (link) that only uses the first
position in each block, rather than averaging everything in the block.
This takes three arguments, the source trajectory, the output file, and
the number of lower level blocks to include in a higher level block.
The following is an example that aggregates 16 blocks for each level of
course graining.<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.CalculateSquareDisplacementMultiTau
-src=Trajectory07.mdp.sdb -dst=SquareDisplacement07.sd.sdb -agg=16<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="MSDISPCOLSQDISP"></a>
COLLECTING SQUARE DISPLACEMENT<br><br>

Next, the individual files need to be collected together for resampling. This can be done with
the CollectSquareDisplacement program in the msd package. This takes one argument
specifying the name of the output file, and then a list of arguments specifying the files to collect.<br><br>

As an example, if you have ten files named SingleDisp00.sd.sdb through SingleDisp00.sd.sdb, the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.CollectSquareDisplacement
-dst=SingleDisp.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp00.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp01.sd.sdb
-src=SingleDisp02.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp03.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp04.sd.sdb
-src=SingleDisp05.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp06.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp07.sd.sdb
-src=SingleDisp08.sd.sdb -src=SingleDisp09.sd.sdb<br><br>

will collect the square displacements into a single file. Also, it's worth mentioning that,
if the order of the input files for CollectSquareDisplacement is the same as the order from SplitData,
the displacements in the final file will be in the same order as the particles in the trajectory data (while
these programs are unconcerned with particle order, other programs might not be).<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="MSDISPRESSQDISP"></a>
RESAMPLING SQUARE DISPLACEMENT<br><br>

The next step is to actually perform the resampling. This can be done using the program
msd.ResampleSquareDisplacement, which takes the original square displacement file, and pairs
of resample file names and output file names.<br><br>

As an example, if you have three resample files (SortedResamp0.srs.sdb through SortedResamp2.srs.sdb)
and a collection of particle displacements (SingleDisp.sd.sdb), the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.ResampleSquareDisplacement
-src=SingleDisp.sd.sdb -rsi=SortedResamp0.srs.sdb -rso=ResampDisp0.sd.sdb
-rsi=SortedResamp1.srs.sdb -rso=ResampDisp1.sd.sdb -rsi=SortedResamp2.srs.sdb
-rso=ResampDisp2.sd.sdb<br><br>

will create three files (ResampDisp 0 through 2) containing the resampled data from SingleDisp.<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="MSDISPAVGMSDISP"></a>
AVERAGING SQUARE DISPLACEMENT<br><br>

Next, each resampled file will have all the individual square displacements averaged across all particles.
This is done using msd.AverageMeanSquareDisplacement, which takes the name of your resampled data file,
and the name of the output file.<br><br>

As an example, if you have a resampled square displacement file named ResampDisp0.sd.sdb, the following command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.AverageMeanSquareDisplacement -src=ResampDisp0.sd.sdb -dst=ResampDisp0.msd.sdb<br><br>

will average the square displacement across the particles in ResampDisp0.sd.sdb and put the results in ResampDisp0.msd.sdb.<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="MSDISPFITDIFF"></a>
FITTING DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

The next step is to fit the diffusion coefficients from the resampled data. This can be done with
msd.FitDiffusionCoefficient, which takes the maximum curvature to allow, the minimum signal to noise ratio,
the dimensionality of the simulation, the name of the output diffusion coefficient file,
and one or more input files.<br><br>

As an example, if you have two mean square displacement files ResampDisp0.msd.sdb and ResampDisp1.sd.sdb, the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ msd.FitDiffusionCoefficient -cur=0.001
-sig=0.5 -dim=1 -dst=AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb -src=ResampDisp0.msd.sdb
-src=ResampDisp1.msd.sdb<br><br>

will fit the diffusion coefficients from the data (that came from a one dimensional simulation)
in ResampDisp0.msd.sdb and ResampDisp1.msd.sdb (skipping data until the curvature drops below 0.001,
and continuing until the signal to noise drops to 0.5), and put the resulting diffusion coefficients
into AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb.<br><br>

<hr>
<hr>
<a name="COLDIFFCOEFFS"></a>
COLLECTING RESAMPLED COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

If you calculated global diffusion coefficients in multiple batches, you'll need to collect
all the disparate files into a single file. In order to do this, you'll need to use the
diffusion.CollectDiffusionFiles program, which takes the name of an output diffusion file,
and one or more input diffusion files.<br><br>

As an example, if you have two diffusion coefficient files (AvgDiffCoeffs0.dif.sdb and AvgDiffCoeffs1.dif.sdb),
the following command;<br><br>
java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ diffusion.CollectDiffusionFiles
-dst=AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb -src=AvgDiffCoeffs0.dif.sdb
-src=AvgDiffCoeffs1.dif.sdb<br><br>

will collect the individual files into AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb.<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="SUMDIFFCOEFFS"></a>
SUMMARIZING RESAMPLED COEFFICIENTS<br><br>

The last step is to get the average and standard deviation of the collection of diffusion coefficients
using diffusion.DiffusionFileStatistics. This program takes the name of the diffusion coefficient collection
file to read, the name of the statistics file to write, and (optionally) a flag to write the final result
as an XML file (as opposed to a binary file).<br><br>

As an example, if you have a diffusion coefficient collection file named AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb, the following
command;<br><br>

java -cp PATH/TO/DIFFRESJ diffusion.DiffusionFileStatistics -src=AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb -dst=DiffCoeff.dfs.sdx -xml<br><br>

will produce an XML file (DiffCoeff.dfs.sdx) containing the average and standard deviation of the coefficients
in AvgDiffCoeffs.dif.sdb;
