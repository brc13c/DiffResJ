Several test cases are provided to show the various ways DiffResJ can be used. All of them are located in the tests folder.<BR><BR>

BatteryA and BatteryB are single runs of a toy model: atoms move on a one dimensional lattice, randomly changing velocity every time unit.
Both batteries run by streaming data from the hard drive after splitting up the files; follow these examples if your data is extremely large (and maybe go grab a sandwich).
Three different lengths of simulation are provided (these mirror the cases in the main paper).
BatteryA works via mean squared displacement (MSD), and BatteryB works via velocity autocorrelation (VAC).<BR><BR>

BatteryC and BatteryD are single runs of a Lennard-Jones fluid in LAMMPS.
If you want to run these, you will need the LAMMPS executable (lmp_serial) on your path.
These work entirely in RAM; follow these examples if your data will fit in your machine's RAM.
The lengths mirros those in the main paper.
BatteryC works via MSD, BatteryD via VAC.<BR><BR>

BatteryE runs a cosine potential fluid in LAMMPS 200 times. This is an example of how the data in the main paper were generated.
If you want to run these, you will need m4 on your path.
This is more for those trying to figure out the logic in the main paper: however, you may use this approach to determine your worst case underestimation.<BR><BR>
