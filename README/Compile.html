This code only makes use of the standard Java library, so compiling is fairly simple.
A few scripts are provided for compilation: if you have the JDK installed (<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</A>), navigate to the root directory of DiffResJ and run Buildme (.sh on *nix, .bat on Windows).
The script will produce a jar file that can be run directly (for the GUI) or used as the classpath when running from a command line.
