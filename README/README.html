These programs take trajectory data from a molecular dynamics simulation and
calculate a self diffusion coefficient along with an error estimate.<br><br>

For common use cases, a GUI is provided, as well as an all in one command line program.
For more unique (i.e. large scale) cases, the steps in the algorithms are also broken up
into individual programs, along with pre- and post-processors that
may be used to split the work into smaller, independent chunks.<br><br>
