<body>These programs make use of two custom formats, one based on XML, and a binary format.<br><br>The
XML format takes the following form. The top level element is
"&lt;TRAJECTORY&gt;", which contains a number of "&lt;TIME&gt;" and
"&lt;PARTICLE&gt;" elements. Each time element marks a new time in the
simulation (with a "&lt;NEWTIME&gt;" element containing the time), and
each particle element provides the location and velocity of a particle
(with many "&lt;POSITION&gt;" elements containing location in each
dimension, and many "&lt;VELOCITY&gt;" elements containg the velocity
in each dimension). <a href="ExampleTrajectory.xml">An example</a> might make this clearer.<br><br>For
the binary format, each "&lt;TIME&gt;" element produces 0x00000001,
followed by the new time as a double precision floating point number
(big-endian). Each "&lt;PARTICLE&gt;" element produces 0x00000002,
followed by 16 bits describing the number of position elements
(big-endian), then each position element in order as a double, then 16
bits describing the number of velocity elements, then each velocity
element as a double. <a href="ExampleTrajectory.mdp.sdb.txt">An example</a> hex-dump might make this clearer (this example is the XML example as a binary file).<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a href="README.html">Back to Index</a>
